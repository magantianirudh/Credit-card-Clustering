# Credit_card_Clustering_Segmentation

This project centers on the segmentation of credit card customers, which is crucial for credit card companies to enhance targeted marketing strategies, improve risk management, and increase customer loyalty. By using sophisticated data mining techniques, particularly clustering algorithms, our project aims to automatically group credit card customers into distinct segments based on their common characteristics, behaviors, and preferences. The project includes several key goals: pre-processing the data, conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) with various visual tools, implementing clustering, evaluating the results of the clustering, and visualizing these results. We are using the Customer Credit Card (CCC) dataset from Kaggle, which includes behavioral data from around 9,000 credit card users. Our objective is to derive meaningful insights that help credit card companies make well-informed decisions and optimize their use of resources.
